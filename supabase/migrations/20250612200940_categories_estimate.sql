  /* so this is a bit fucky
  first, we estimate the size of postsCategory and profilesCategory
  then, based on their size, we take a bigger or smaller chunk of them as a sample
  this is because there is ofc more variation in smaller sample sizes
  here, we have 100% until a thousand
  with our hopefully representative sample, we can guess the actual number
  both are added up to get the counts in, if i didnâ€™t fuck up too bad, little time
